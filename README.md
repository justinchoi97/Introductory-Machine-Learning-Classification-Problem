# Introductory-Machine-Learning-Classification-Problem
Exploration of machine learning classification structures and the effects of hyper-parameter tuning

# problem 
• You are provided with a dataset of tumour measurements
• The aim of this assignment is to build some classifiers and evaluate their performance. 
The classification task is to predict whether a tumour is malignant (M) or benign (B).

• Using the sklearn library, you will build the following classifiers
1. a naive Bayes classifier
2. a nearest neighbours classifier
3. a decision tree classifier
4. a support vector machine classifier

Each of the classfier except naive Bayes classifier is tuned by performing hyper-paramater tuning.

Run classifier.py to see the simulation.
